# Java Functional Programming
#### Does the language support Functional programming?
* Lambdas stem from the world of functional programming languages, so obviously Java 8 is a functional programming language.
# C# Functional Programming
#### Does the language support Functional programming?
* Yes, its pretty clear that the C# developers have taken a lot of inspiration from functional programming languages in the past few years.
#### Here are some examples why I felt this way:
* C# 2.0 brought us parametric polymorphism (or "generics"). I've heard that Dom Syme, one of the creators of F#, was largely responsible for implementing generics in the .NET BCL.
* C# 2.0 also allows programmers to pass and returns functions as values for higher-order functions, and has limited support for anonymous delegates.
* C# 3.0 and 3.5 improved support anonymous functions for true closures.
* LINQ can be considered C#'s own flavor of list comprehensions.
* Anonymous types look like an approximation of ML records
* Type-inference is a given.
