# Java
#### James Gosling is credited with creating java in June 1991. Originally it was aimed at the digital cable television industry but it shifted to the internet. At this time the first web browsers were being released and java was perfect for embedding new technology into the browser. Gosling wanted to use a syntax that would be familiar to C/C++ users but didn't want the other low level features. There were 5 primary goals that java set out to tackle
  1. It must be "simple, object-oriented, and familiar".
  2. It must be "robust and secure".
  3. It must be "architecture-neutral and portable".
  4. It must execute with "high performance".
  5. It must be "interpreted, threaded, and dynamic".
#### Java 1.0 was released in January 1996 for Solaris, Windows, Mac OS Classic, and Linux. It came with the virtual machine, class libraries, and development tools like the java compiler
# C#
#### Microsoft's lead architect for developing C# was Anders Hejlsberg. In interviews he has stated that it was flaws in most major programming languages (C++, Java, Delphi, Smalltalk) which drove the development of C#. There was also a need to port the .NET framework and its class libraries into a better language. At the time these class libraries were written using a managed code compiler system called Simple Managed C. The same James Gosling who created Java claimed that C# was an immitation of Java without the reliability, productivity and security. Hejlsberg argued that it was more similar to C++ but regardless, the two languages began to take seperate paths after 2005. For example C# and Java both introduced generics but C# treats them like any other class and implements them in runtime.
